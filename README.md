Few things to keep in mind

1. Okay guys. So this is p2. We've got to nail this one since we fucked up the last one and as Matt was saying, lets get this done possibly by Friday.

2. The TaskList is a good place to keep track of stuff. Let's keep it regularly updated, even the subtasks, DIRECTLY ON THE MASTER. '-' stands for to be done, 'o' means someone is working on it and '+' means it has been done. I think everyone should make it a rule of thumb to update this file once when you begin your working session and once when you're at its end.

3. Regarding branching, I think it will be a good idea to have a different branch for each class. If there are multiple people working on different methods of the same class please work on the same branch, else combining the 2 branches will be really difficult. AVOID pushing directly to the master unless you're updating something very insignificant and unproblematic.

4. If you plan on completing your work in multiple sittings, please update your files on the branch that you are working on, after each sitting. This is really important for 2 reasons. a) Some classes are dependent on other classes so other people need to be constantly updated with your work to work on their own classes. b) If for some reason you are not able to complete the task that you took up, it will be easier for the person who steps in to complete it.

5. Once you've completed your work on your branch, if you are unsure of your code you should ask the other team members to review it and then later open a pull request to merge it to the master.

6. Lets not leave commenting to the later days. It will be easier for someone to refer to your code if it is properly commented.

7. We should keep a deadline for the project sometime before the actual deadline so that if by that time we are unable to complete tasks that we took up, someone else can immediately start working on it without any correspondence.

8. Thanks and peace.
